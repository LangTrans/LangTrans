LangTrans is a syntactic preprocessor that lets you customize any programming language's syntax.<br>
It translates your custom syntax into the original language, allowing personalized coding while adhering to language specifications.<br>
Using regular expressions, it extracts tokens from your custom language to generate the original syntax.

## Quick Start

There are two ways you can install LangTrans:

### **Clone Repository**

Use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LangTrans/LangTrans.git
```

After cloning, navigate into the LangTrans directory.

### **Download Executable**

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/LangTrans/LangTrans/releases) and download the [latest executable]((https://github.com/LangTrans/LangTrans/releases/download/1.6/langtrans.exe)) or an [installer](https://github.com/LangTrans/LangTrans/releases/download/1.6/LangTrans_Installer.exe).

## Usage

You can use LangTrans from the command line using the following structure:

```bash
py langtrans.py <SoureFileName> <OutputFileName> <SyntaxRepr> <PatternRepr>
```

* **SoureFileName**: Name of the source code file written with your new syntax
* **OutputFileName**: Name of the source code file you want to generate with the original syntax
* **SyntaxRepr**: Name of the YAML file for your syntax representation (without .yaml extension)
* **PatternRepr**: Name of the YAML file for the pattern representation of the original language (without .yaml extension)

### Flags

You can also use the following options with the langtrans.py command:

* `-h`: Displays help information
* `-v`: Activates verbose mode
* `-y`: Executes the 'after' command automatically
* `-n`: Exits without executing the 'after' command

## Examples

Here is our take on custom [Python](https://github.com/LangTrans/Python_Trans):

```py
#Print
p"Hello World"

# Anonymous function
inc = (x) => x+1

# Lambda function
twice(x) = 2*x

# Single Line try-except
try inc("1") Exception print("Error:",err)

# Print Done if x is defined other wise Failed
print((x||True)?"Done":"Failed")

# Single Line if and check x defined or not
print('x is not defined') if !x

# Pipe Syntax
1 -> inc
|> print

# Arithmetic operations with functions
print((inc+twice)(3))

#Scope syntax work like in javascript
#scope1#
print("Scope1")
print("Done")

#scope2#
print("scope2")
print("Done")

#PEP 359 - The "make" statement
make type name(arg):
  x = 1
  y = 3
```

Here is a sample of the customized [Common Lisp](https://github.com/LangTrans/LISP_Trans):

```lisp
func printhis(s):
  format(t,s)
printhis("Customized!")
```
